Generate the documentation in HTML format
-----------------------------------------

Make sure that you have :ref:`Sphinx <tools>` installed.

The root directory for all the documentation is "doc" and there you will find a
*Makefile* with instructions how to generate the documentation in various
formats.

If you have *Make* installed, you can issue the command ``make html`` on Linux
or ``make htmlw`` on Windows to generate the documentation in HTML format. The
index page will be output in "doc/_build/html/index.html"
