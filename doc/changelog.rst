Version 1.0.0
-------------

**Released on 30 September 2013.**

After about 4.5 years in development, timeline 1.0.0 is released. This is the
first time we increment the x-component of the version number
(:ref:`label-version-number`). The main reason for doing so is that timeline
can no longer read files produced with timeline versions before 0.10.0
(released over 3 years ago).

The other big thing in 1.0.0 is that the experimental support for dates before
year 0 is no longer experimental. We have rewritten large parts of the date
handling partly to be able to support BC dates in a better way.

* Implemented export to image for whole timeline
* Implemented vertical zooming with Alt+Mousewheel
* Implemented vertical scrolling of timeline events
* Select all, Ctrl-A implemented in event editor description
* New entries in categories tree context menu allowing parent/children
  check/uncheck
* New checkbox under categories tree, used to view categories individually
  independent on parent checked-status
* Dialog for sending feedback (available from help menu and event editor)
* Balloon size restricted to not expand over timeline border
* Help documentation updated
* Show numerical day number together with day name when zooming to week

Bug fixes:

* Fixed exception when right-clicking in CatergoriesEditor
* When 'ends today' start time can't be > now, anymore
* Search bar gives no exception when searching twice or using search button

Removed features:

* Printing: Use export to image and print image instead
