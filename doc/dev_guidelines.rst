Coding Guidelines
=================

We try to follow the `Style Guide for Python Code
<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. Other guidelines and exceptions
to the standard are listed here.

Multiline docstrings
--------------------

We prefer to write **multiline** docstrings strings like this::

    """
    One line summary.

    More comments...
    """

instead of like this::

    """One line summary.

    More comments...

    """
