Status
======

This document describes the project status: what is happening right now and
what might happen in the future.

A note about version numbers
----------------------------

Timeline uses a three-component version numbering system (X.Y.Z).

Z is only incremented when bugs are corrected or translations are updated. The
functionality of the program is the same for all X.Y versions.

Y is incremented every time a new feature is added.

X is incremented when the new version is no longer compatible with previous
versions or when the program undergoes some big change or significant
milestone.

Release cycle
-------------

Roughly every third month there is a new feature release of Timeline (if new
features have been developed). That means that Y will increase by one.

If critical bugs are found in a X.Y release, we try to fix them as fast as
possible and make the fix available in a bugfix release (X.Y is the same but Z
is incremented by one).

Future plans
------------

**1.0.0**

For the first incompatible version we would like to clean up some parts:

* **Get rid of printing.** Printing does not work very well. A better way to
  print is to generate an image and then print the image from another program.

* **Get rid of old file formats**. It was a long time since the old file format
  was used. It would be nice to get rid of that code.

* **Get rid of extended date ranges / Think of a better solution**. Extended
  date ranges does not work very well and it added lots of complexity to the
  code. It would be nice to get rid of it all together. Perhaps we can come up
  with a better way to handle extended dates?
